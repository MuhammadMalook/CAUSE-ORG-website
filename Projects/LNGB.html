              CAUSE is implementing a Project by ACTED with support of UK Aid,
              naming Leave No Girls Behind (LNGB) in two District of Sindh
              Kashmore and Jacobabad. The project’s envisioned impact is to
              improve life chances of the most marginalized girls by
              contributing to improved learning outcomes and sustainable
              transition to education, training and employment. Three outcomes
              underpin this: (1) Learning, referring to the learning outcomes of
              marginalized girls, (2) Transition to formal education, training
              or employment and (3) Sustainability of these transitions and
              project impact on education.

                >The overarching Theory of Change is that education is valuable
                for girls in and of itself. In addition, educating girls
                delivers significant economic, social and health benefits (e.g.
                increased maternal health outcomes, reduced rates of HIV,
                increased income generating capacity) to girls, families and
                communities. However, improved literacy and numeracy is not
                enough; girls must be equipped with confidence and skills to
                transition to further opportunities. This will be advanced by
                preparatory classes for formal exams; internships; start up
                business grants aimed at retaining girls and reducing barriers
                to transition by connecting girls with further
                education/livelihood opportunities. To ensure sustainability two
                outcomes (1) empowerment and (2) acceptance must be met,
                underpinned by two outputs namely enhanced participation of
                girls’ in family, schools and community life and strengthened
                community support for girls’ education. Associated activities
                aim to sensitize girls, their families and community on the
                value of girls’ education through: mobilization of coaches;
                extra-curricular activities; engaging communities through SMCs
                and advocacy efforts. This will contribute to improved access to
                education and learning and transition outcomes for not only
                direct beneficiaries but future cohorts of girls. The project’s
                assumed barriers to education and corresponding activities align
                with UNICEF’s Global Strategy for Girl’s Education. Building on
                this, target direct beneficiary girls have tailored learning and
                transition objectives – with girls aged 10-13 years to benefit
                from an Accelerated Learning Programme with life skills to
                support transition to further education; and girls aged 14-19
                years to benefit from basic literacy/numeracy training with life
                skills to access livelihood opportunities and become better
                equipped to participate in family and community life. Improved
                literacy and numeracy will have a positive impact on girls’
                empowerment their families’ wellbeing and their communities’
                resilience contributing to improved life chances of the most
                marginalized and vulnerable girls.</span
