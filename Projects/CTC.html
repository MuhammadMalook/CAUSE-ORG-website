        The aim of Coalition for Tobacco Control – Pakistan is to strengthen the
        development and implementation of policies based on the provisions of
        Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) through advocacy
        campaigns and acting as a technical resource for the Ministry of Health.
        <br />
        Coalition for Tobacco Control – Pakistan (CTC-Pak) has been advocating
        for stronger measures for tobacco control by the translation and
        adaptation of FCTC provisions into national tobacco control laws and was
        successful in convincing the signing and ratification of the FCTC by the
        Government of Pakistan. This led to promulgation of the national tobacco
        control laws which ban smoking at public places and public service
        vehicles, restrictions on the advertising campaigns of the tobacco
        industry and bigger and clearer health warnings on cigarette packs.
        <br />
        Despite the introduction of these legislative measures, a comprehensive
        approach towards effective tobacco control is still lacking. These
        loopholes allow the tobacco industry to exploit an under regulated
        market. <br />
        There is a strong need to keep the issue of tobacco control on the
        agenda of the policy-makers. The prevalence of smoking in youth as well
        as adult is high in Pakistan and the loopholes in the existing laws
        provide an environment for the industry to exploit especially in areas
        where implementation of the law is not strong and the consumption of
        tobacco is high.<br />
        With support from Bloomberg Global Initiative for Tobacco Control,
        Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and The Union Against Tuberculosis and
        Lung Diseases, CTC-Pak through its members is in the process of
        monitoring the implementation of the tobacco control statutes in
        Pakistan and advocating for demand in reforms within the existing
        tobacco control legislations highlighting the need for the following so
        that a holistic legislative environment can be created for tobacco
        control:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Development and adoption of legislative measures for a comprehensive
            ban on tobacco promotion and advertisements
          </li>
          <li>Pictorial health warnings</li>
          <li>Raise in tobacco taxes</li>
          <li>Controlling smuggling of tobacco products</li>
          <li>Identifying issues related to tobacco</li>
        </ul>
        The strength of CTC-Pak is its membership who is already engaged in
        tobacco control work. The partners of CTC-Pak bring a range of expertise
        to the coalition and together present a unified front which is dedicated
        to the control of tobacco consumption in Pakistan. CTC-Pak requires
        support and commitment from civil society organizations for effective
        advocacy campaigns for raising awareness among masses on the issue of
        tobacco control by building their capacity and knowledge base on the
        tobacco control issue.
